 	abstract = {Since modern software systems are large and complex, appropriate abstractions of their structure are needed to make them more understandable and, thus, easier to maintain. Software clustering techniques are useful to support the creation of these abstractions by producing architectural-level views of a system's structure directly from its source code. This paper examines the Bunch clustering system which, unlike other software clustering tools, uses search techniques to perform clustering. Bunch produces a subsystem decomposition by partitioning a graph of the entities (e.g., classes) and relations (e.g., function calls) in the source code. Bunch uses a fitness function to evaluate the quality of graph partitions and uses search algorithms to find a satisfactory solution. This paper presents a case study to demonstrate how Bunch can be used to create views of the structure of significant software systems. This paper also outlines research to evaluate the software clustering results produced by Bunch.},

 	abstract = {In order to recover software architecture, various clustering techniques have been created to automatically partition a software system into meaningful subsystems. While these techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness, we observe that a key feature within most software systems has not been fully exploited: most well-designed systems follow strong architectural design rules that split the overall system into modules. These design rules are often manifested as special program constructs, such as shared data structures or abstract interfaces, which should not belong to any of the subordinate modules. We contribute a new perspective of architecture recovery based on this rationale, which enables the combination of design-rule-based clustering with other clustering techniques, as well as enabling the splitting of a large system into subsystems. We evaluated our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, using both open source and real industrial software projects.},
